This is edited X-Ray Engine v1.0007rc1 (by xrModder). Included some small features:
- Console command "-g_can_save" for enabling/disabling quicksaves; also some hidden default console commands are now enabled (?)
- No crash because of missing textures
- Fubles replaced with UAH
- Weapon bobbing feature from LA
